# Hungry Humans (Recipe App)

I often have trouble trying to figure out what I want to make for dinner. Looking at recipes online is often filled with one individuals favorite recipes. Why not make an app that allows the user to sort through many people's favorite recipes? 

This is an app that allows the user to create, read, update & delete recipes. As a user you can also look at other people who have signed in and explore their profiles. This app also allows the user to write & read reviews.

## Getting Started
Visit the app here: https://hungry-humans.herokuapp.com/
